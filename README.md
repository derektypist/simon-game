# Simon Game

According to Wikipedia, Simon is a game of memory skill.  The aim of the project is to have
functionality simliar to https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/obYBjE.

## UX

### User Stories

As a user, I am presented with a random series of button presses.

As a user, each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses, but with additional step.

As a user, I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of buttons presses plays, and when I personally press a button.

As a user, if I press the wrong button, I am notified I have done so, and that series of buttons preeses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.

As a user, if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step.

As a user, I can play in strict mode, where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses.

As a user, I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct.  I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.

## Features

To test memory skill.  Ability to play in strict mode.  Notification of victory.
